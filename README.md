# ⚔️ Excalibur FRC 6738 - Crescendo 2024 

Welcome to the official repository of Excalibur FRC 6738 for the Crescendo 2024 season...
Welcome to the official repository of Excalibur FRC 6738 for the Crescendo 2024 season. This Java-based robotics control system is meticulously crafted for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) robots, incorporating cutting-edge technology and leveraging the WPILib library, the industry standard for FRC robots. Developed with Gradle, this project represents our team's commitment to excellence in the field of robotics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These comprehensive instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.2 or any other Java IDE
- Gradle

### 🚀 Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Build the project using Gradle.

## 🌐 Project Structure

Our project is intricately organized into distinct subsystems, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the robot's functionality. Key subsystems include:

- `Swerve`: Responsible for the robot's movement, incorporating methods for precise control, autonomous routines, and pathfinding.
- `Shooter`: Manages the robot's shooting mechanism, offering control over the shooter's state, target locations, and various shooter-related commands.

These subsystems are modular and independent, allowing for efficient testing, debugging, and seamless collaboration among team members. The code's organization is intuitive, ensuring accessibility for new contributors.

## 🎮 Usage

The robot's behavior is orchestrated through a series of commands defined in the code. These commands empower the control of movement, shooting mechanisms, and other functionalities. Commands can be combined to create sophisticated behaviors and strategies.
