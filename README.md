# ⚔️ Excalibur FRC 6738 - Crescendo 2024

Welcome to the official repository of Excalibur FRC 6738 for the Crescendo 2024 season. This Java-based robotics control system is meticulously crafted for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) robots, incorporating cutting-edge technology and leveraging the WPILib library, the industry standard for FRC robots. Developed with Gradle, this project represents our team's commitment to excellence in the field of robotics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These comprehensive instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.2 or any other Java IDE
- Gradle

### 🚀 Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Build the project using Gradle.

## 🌐 Project Structure

Our project is intricately organized into distinct subsystems, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the robot's functionality. Key subsystems include:

- `Swerve`: Responsible for the robot's movement, incorporating methods for precise control, autonomous routines, and pathfinding.
- `Shooter`: Manages the robot's shooting mechanism, offering control over the shooter's state, target locations, and various shooter-related commands.

These subsystems are modular and independent, allowing for efficient testing, debugging, and seamless collaboration among team members. The code's organization is intuitive, ensuring accessibility for new contributors.

## 🎮 Usage

The robot's behavior is orchestrated through a series of commands defined in the code. These commands empower the control of movement, shooting mechanisms, and other functionalities. Commands can be combined to create sophisticated behaviors and strategies.
